These folders contain various midi results from the SUNMASK paper. For listening to these midi files, we use the "timidity" commandline program, though many midi players may suffice. 

evaluation_sampled_mid_many_cleanup/top_20/*.mid represents the best curated samples from SUNMASK.



For all midis, we present 3 formats "raw" which is the sound rendered with an acoustic grand piano midi soundfont, "voice" which uses a choral type soundfont, and "quartet" which uses a combination of oboe, English horn, clarinet, and bassoon. For the top 20 these are further rendered at 90, 60, and 60 bpm respectively.

As an example to listen to all quartet format midis in the "top 20" folder, we use the following command `timidity evaluation_sampled_mid_many_cleanup/top_20/download_sunmask_typical_True_*quartet*.mid` . Similar can be used for any of the midi files in this supplemental folder.




evaluation_sampled_mid_many_cleanup/ shows the experimental results of generating 200 samples with the best performing midi model, and selecting a "greatest hits" of the top 20 according to the grading metric. We also include an example of the "grading reports" used for this analysis in this folder.

evaluation_sampled_mid_fixedbpm/ contains the midi files which were graded to create Table 1 in the paper. All were generated at a BPM of 50, though the grading metric is independent of the BPM codified in the midi file itself.

evalution_sampled_mid_inpainting/ contains the infilling resuls for generated versions of "Ode to Joy" harmonizations, as shown in Figures 3:9 of the SUNMASK paper.
